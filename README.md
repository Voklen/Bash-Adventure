# Bash-Adventure
A "Game" that you can play purely through a bash terminal by navigating (mainly) with "cd" and interacting (mainly) with a command-line text editor.

## This game is currently work-in-progress, I would recommend coming back when it is complete

To start off on this adventure you will need:

A bash terminal  
A basic ability to use the "cd" command  
A command-line text editor (And the knowledge to use it)

If you already have all of these, then you can begin! Just cd into this directory, and open up "instructor.txt" with you text editor to get started, they'll explain everything. Good Luck!

If not:

## Get a Bash terminal
*NIX distro:\
Just try searching for "Terminal" in your programs and it should come up. If it doesn't... idk... search it up.

MacOS:\
Type "Terminal" into spotlight search, and it should be the first one.

Windows:\
Get a *NIX OS... At least try one?... Fine. Here you go. https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/

Android:\

IOS/IpadOS:\
I wouldn't recommend it but if you REALLY want to, https://opensource.com/article/20/9/run-linux-ios

## How to use the "cd" command
cd stands for Change Directory (another name for folder). To use it just type `cd` followed by the directory you want to go to. By default, the terminal will start you in the home directory. So:
`cd Desktop/`
will take you to the Desktop folder (Linux file names and bash commands are case sensitive btw) and your terminal will go from:\
`username@computername:~$`\
to:\
`username@computername:~/Desktop$`\
You can also move through multiple directories in one command. For example:\
`cd Downloads/Bash-Adventure-main/`\
if both these folders exist you should now be at:\
`username@computername:~/Downloads/Bash-Adventure-main$\`\
You can now use this to navigate to the folder this file is in.
