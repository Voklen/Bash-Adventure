A simple, single-story house stood at the end of the road with a large horse track spread out behind it. Its bright white appearance with sky-blue highlights made it seem almost other-worldly, with well-oiled bi-directional double doors people could speed in and out of the building at any time. Looking through the large front windows, you saw the interior was composed of a few large, open rooms. They were simple, with every object seeming to have a clear purpose, no frivolous paintings or numerous pens scattered around.
