An old man dressed in plain, long white robes with socks and sandels and a cared for white beard stands before you. "Welcome" he announses, in a voice that sounded 40 years younger than his apperence "to an adveture through the land of [temporary name]. In each directory(folder) you will find at least one text file, like this one, which represents an object, person, creature, or landscape. Most of the time there will also be a folder. You move by simply changing directory into it, if you ever want to go back just type `cd ..`. So when your ready, you can check out the library or, if you're feeling confident, walk straight out of the Exit(remember, file names are case sesitive). Good Luck and have fun!".
